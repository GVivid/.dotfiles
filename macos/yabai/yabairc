# A heads up; make sure that in mission control "When switching to an
# application, switch  to a space with open windows for the application"
# is disabled if you want to switch windows with shkd and yabai.
# I had an error where whenever I clicked on an application in another desktop
# Dock crashed and then yabai got stuck because it couldn't change focus
# because it thought an animation was still playing
